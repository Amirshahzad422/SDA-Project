Use the same system you previously modeled in your earlier DFD assignment. Carefully analyze each process and sub-process in your Context-Level, Level-1, and Level-2 DFDs. Implement at least one Level-1 process and its Level-2 processes in C++. Code must follow a modular structure based on DFD decomposition. Use comments in your code to indicate which function corresponds to which DFD process. Simulate data stores using files, databases, or in-memory data structures (like lists/dictionaries). Ensure data flows between functions/modules in the same logical way as shown in the DFDs. 
During implementation, if you realize that your original DFD is incomplete, incorrect, or inconsistent, revise the affected DFD(s). Test the logical correctness of your implementation.
